# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This project was used to test my ability at using Web APIs. The product is a short JavaScript quiz that keeps track of time and score as you go though the quiz. After completing the quiz you recieve your score and you can store it to the highscore page.  This project has taught me how useful it will be in the future to get to use third party APIs. If I would have used jQuery for example a lot of my js code could have been shorter. This was also the first project where I experimented with hideing certain sections of a page while another is present. This caused some problems that had to be sorted out as they arrised.
